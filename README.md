# Civil Shear Modulus and Damping Prediction App

A simple **Streamlit**-based web application for predicting Shear Modulus and Damping behavior in civil engineering materials using machine learning. This app allows users to input features and visualize predicted Shear Modulus and Damping results.

##  Features

-  Predicts Shear Modulus and Damping targets based on structure and environment features
-  Uses a trained machine learning model (Python backend)
-  Built with **Streamlit** for quick interactive UI
-  Organized project structure with script and dependencies

##  Built With

- **Python**
- **Streamlit** — for UI and deployment
- **scikit-learn** - for model training
- **NumPy, pandas** — for data handling

## Run application

Make sure Python is installed, then run:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

```python app.py```
